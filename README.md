# HighLoad-Systems

## For what?
In this repository I train my backend skills, also study high-load and
distributed systems basics.

*Below you can see all projects that helped me studied backend. You can find more info
in the project that interests you.*
___
* ### __*[echo-server](https://github.com/bug00n/HighLoad-Systems/tree/main/echo-server-cpp)*__
  
  There I understanded how TCP/IP works and how sockets are created on a low-level in Windows.
  Also I learned Markdown. Now I practice it by writing a docs)
  
* ### __*[http-server](https://github.com/bug00n/HighLoad-Systems/tree/main/HTTP-server-cpp)*__
  
  This is my first project with division code into different files.
  I found out what header and executable files are.
  
* ### __*[account-manager](https://github.com/bug00n/HighLoad-Systems/tree/main/account-manager-py)*__
  
  There I got to know how Redis and PostgreSQL introduced into Python.
  Also I tried FastAPI for the first time.  
  I had some problems with testing the API by using uvicorn, but
  it helped me understand how uvicorn and processes work.

* ### __*[account-manager](https://github.com/bug00n/HighLoad-Systems/tree/main/messager-cpp)*__
  
  I worked with asynchronicity in C++, experimented with OOP. I solved
  problems with dependencies by using header-files. Also there some troubles
  with segmentation fault because constructor initializes variable in order
  which specified specified inside the class but no inside constructor. Also
  there I for the first time used library boost::asio.
